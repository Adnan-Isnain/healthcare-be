## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adnan-Isnain/healthcare-be.git
cd healthcare-be
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/healthcare?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

Adjust the `DATABASE_URL` according to your PostgreSQL configuration.

### Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database named `healthcare` (or whatever you defined in your `.env` file).

Run migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Seed the database with initial data:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### Run the Application

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000

## User Roles and Permissions

The system includes four predefined roles:

- **ADMIN**: Full access to all features
- **DOCTOR**: Can create, read, and update treatments
- **NURSE**: Can read treatments and patient information
- **STAFF**: Basic access

## Test Users

The seed script creates the following test users (password includes on the seeder):

- Admin: `admin@example.com`
- Doctor: `doctor@example.com`
